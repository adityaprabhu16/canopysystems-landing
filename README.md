Deploying the Application:
 - Vercel.com
 - Connect github
 - Go to projects, import Git repository
 - Deploy
 - Queues the build for our react application, address any errors, and then you can visit the website.
 - NOTE: you'll need to move your assets folder into the public directory so Vercel can access them during deployment.
   - In vite, this would also involve embedding your paths directly within the JSX elements with the updated path instead of importing it at the top.
